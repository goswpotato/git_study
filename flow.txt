download and install git, it might not be difficult
it 'might' be better to use Git bash(command line) instead of Git GUI, because I can't find some function in Git GUI
but you may be possible to use Git GUI or other GUI tools for git better than me


I assume you want to start a new project and cooperate with others
(or you want to participate into a project that someone has built in Internet)

Github

1. go github to get an account, just regist and verify by e-mail. That won't cause any problems, I guess......
2. if you want to start a new project......
	get into your account and new a repository(also called "repo"). It's recommended to add a README initially.

open Git bash

1. setup for comfiguration(optional ????)
	I don't know whether it matters if you don't set these configurations......
	
	$ git config --list
		this command can see your configurations
	$ git config user.name
		this command can set your user name
	$ git config user.email
		this command can set your email


the following would be working on
D:\git_study (local)
https://github.com/xxxx/git_study.git (remote, assume your user name on Github is xxxx)

maybe the name can be diffrent

2. clone the project 
	$ cd /d
		get into D drive
	$ git clone https://github.com/xxxx/git_study.git
		clone the project from remote host
	if you get into the folder ($ cd /d/git_study), you'll see (master), it means you are on the master branch


new file or edited
	if you new or finish editing a file (assume is study.txt), you should stage it

	$ git add study.txt
		stage the study.txt in staging area
	$ git add --all
		stage the all files in staging area
