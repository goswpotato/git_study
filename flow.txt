download and install git, it might not be difficult
it 'might' be better to use Git bash(command line) instead of Git GUI, because I can't find some function in Git GUI
but you may be possible to use Git GUI or other GUI tools for git better than me


I assume you want to start a new project and cooperate with others
(or you want to participate into a project that someone has built in Internet)

Github

1. go github to get an account, just regist and verify by e-mail. That won't cause any problems, I guess......
2. if you want to start a new project......
	get into your account and new a repository(also called "repo"). It's recommended to add a README initially.

open Git bash

1. setup for comfiguration(optional ????)
	I don't know whether it matters if you don't set these configurations......
	
	$ git config --list
		this command can see your configurations
	$ git config user.name
		this command can set your user name
	$ git config user.email
		this command can set your email


the following would be working on
D:\git_study (local)
https://github.com/xxxx/git_study.git (remote, assume your user name on Github is xxxx)

maybe the name can be diffrent

2. clone the project 
	$ cd /d
		get into D drive
	$ git clone https://github.com/xxxx/git_study.git
		clone the project from remote host
	if you get into the folder ($ cd /d/git_study), you'll see (master), it means you are on the master branch


$ git status
	you can know the status of files in your local project
	
new file or edited
	if you new or finish editing a file (assume is study.txt), you should stage it

	$ git add study.txt
		stage the study.txt in staging area
	$ git add -A
		stage the all files in staging area

after stage, if you want to commit(equal to make a history??)
	$ git commit
		the command window would jump out an editor, you can use it as vim editor
		enter the message for this commit, save it and exit (:wq)



$ gitk --all
	output the graph of branches, but it's just a graph???





		
you may do two operations with remote end most often
"origin master" is the main branch in remote end, "origin" means remote, "master" is the name of branch?????
	$ git push origin master
		push the current local branch on remote end
	$ git fetch orgin master
		update the status of remote branch
	$ git pull origin master
		pull the remote branch into current local branch

it's better not to directly push or pull, it may harm the branch you are using or the workable branch on remote end
it's better to create($ git checkout......) a new (local/remote) branch, and (pull/push) to that branch
and then merge to (local/remote) master branch

about basic merge operation, see the 1st reference
